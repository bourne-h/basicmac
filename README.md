# Basic MAC

**NOTE:
LoRa Basics™ MAC is scheduled to be deprecated within the year.
Semtech recommends that people designing new LoRa®-based solutions use LoRaMAC-Node instead.**

Basic MAC is a portable implementation of the LoRa™ Alliance's LoRaWAN™
specification in the C programming language. It is a fork of IBM's LMiC
library, and supports multiple regions, which are selectable at compile and/or
run time. It can handle Class A, Class B, and Class C devices.
